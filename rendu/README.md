## Estimation of Obesity Levels based on eating habits and physical condition
#### By NADESU Pratheswar & NENEZ Owen

For this data Visualisation project in Python, we have to visualize data from :
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition+

This dataset include data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from South America countries such as Mexico, Peru and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition. The data contains 17 attributes and 2111 records, the records are labeled with the class variable NObesity (Obesity Level), that allows classification of the data using the values of Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III. 77% of the data was generated synthetically using the Weka tool and the SMOTE filter, 23% of the data was collected directly from users through a web platform.

Our main goal is to see whether the data can validate the impact of several factors that propitiate the apparition of obesity problems.

We will proceed by these following steps:
    
    - Data cleaning
    - Data Visualisation
    - Obesity Level Prediction
    - API Building
    
 TO VISUALIZE API FLASK:
    - open Anaconda prompt
    - go to the folder "PythonViz"
    - execute this command : "python views.py"
    - open the page with the url given
